# Network Security & Authentication Protocols Prototype

A practical collection of network security protocol implementations designed for education and experimentation. This repository provides clear, minimal examples of widely-used security protocols to help students, developers, and security professionals understand the foundations of secure communication. Over time, this repository will include more protocols, authentication schemes, and migration strategies for post-quantum cryptography. This project is a starting point for anyone interested in secure systems, protocol design, or cryptographic research.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Minimal, readable code** for each protocol, focusing on clarity and educational value.
- **Step-by-step guides** in each protocol's directory to help you run and understand the prototypes.
- **A collaborative environment** for learning, sharing, and improving security protocol implementations.

## Protocols Included

- [TLS (Transport Layer Security)](tls/Readme.md): Basic TLS client-server with CA-signed certificates.
- [mTLS (Mutual TLS)](mtls/Readme.md): Mutual authentication using client and server certificates.
- [QUIC with TLS 1.3](quic/Readme.md): Modern transport protocol with built-in TLS 1.3 security.
- [IPSec](ipsec/Readme.md): Secure IP communication using ESP and AH protocols.

More protocols and authentication schemes will be added. We also plan to demonstrate how to migrate these protocols to post-quantum cryptography.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse the protocol directories** listed above. Each contains a README with setup instructions, code explanations, and usage examples.
2. **Clone this repository** and follow the instructions in the protocol-specific README files to run the prototypes on your machine.
3. **Experiment and learn** by modifying the code, changing configurations, or extending the prototypes.
